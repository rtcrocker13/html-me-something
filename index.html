                    <h1>Wahington Monument</h1>
                    <p>
                        The Washington Monument has undergone millions of dollars of renovations in the last few years, unfortunatley the obelisk is experiencing some electical issues
                        which meant that the interior of the Monument was closed to the public. It was, however, an amazing experience to see the monument first hand to see how large 
                        that it really is.

                    <h1>Jefferson Monument</h1>
                    <p>
                        The Jefferson Monument was a surprisingly impressive affair, more so because there were very few people there and it was like having the place to ourselves. 
                        The structure was amazing surrounded by the thousands of cherry trees donated from Japan and there was an awesome view of the Washington Monument from the steps. 
                        The quotes on the wall may have misrepresented Jefferson because they were about God and Jefferson was notoriously unreligious.

                        The view from the columned entrance was amazing, you could see the the Washington Monument from so many locations.

                    <h1>Capitol Building</h1>
                    <p>
                        We actually went through the Capitol building twice. The first time was interesting but it was quick and we were not able to see much. The next morning however we 
                        went to a town hall with Clair McCaskill and her staff got us tickets to go sit in the senate gallery which was a cool experience. We were also able to travel in the 
                        tunnels that run all over the city and take the small open air tram which was very fun to see.

                    <h1>White House</h1>
                    <p>
                        The White House was, as expected, heavily guarded. It actually had an extra barrior around it that kept the public away from the main fence. In front of the main fence 
                        there were security officers that were armed to the teeth and protected with armored barriors. Despite all this it was really neat to see the building in person. 
                        Unfortunatley it can take many monthes to get granted a tour of the White House so all we got to do was look.

                        At the beginning you could walk right up to the white house and knock on the door, not anymore.

                    <h1>National Portrait Gallery</h1>
                    <p>
                        The National Portrait Gallery was my surprise favorite destination of the trip. It was unexpectedly moving to see the portraits of some of our countries most influencial 
                        people. It was particularly interesting to see President Obama and FDR's portraits. Clinton's portrait was easily the biggest and you could definetly see his sense of humor 
                        in his choice of artist.

                        This was a surprising and amazing piece of the trip. Obama looked great, the crowd was pretty crazy though!
